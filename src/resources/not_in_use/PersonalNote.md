## A Personal Note
A common question that I am asked across the interviewing table is "Why did you get two majors?" In such an environment I usually don't have the time to answer this question to desired completion, but on this platform I believe I can afford a more drawn-out response.  

At the most superficial level, [research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics] (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6) shows that the demand for software development skills is expected to increase at a "much faster" rate than the average across all occupations.  The same Bureau also reports a much slower growth rate than average for materials engineering jobs.  However, [a study conducted by Swerea](https://www.swerea.se/sites/default/files/the_future_of_materials_swerea.pdf) shows that materials development has an "endless demand" due to product requirements that continue to grow more stringent.   Pages 52-53 of the linked study show a possible roadmap for materials development in Sweden. If we picture a world of "choose one or the other", having the knowledge base of multiple disciplines can make a person competitive as a hire choice, or even integral for a multidiscipinary engineering team.

But this is a poor answer because it extracts a need from economic data, without a 




### Personal Note
A common question I receive across the interviewing table is "Why did I study both MSE and CS?"  
At the superficial level, having some knowledge in multiple disciplines opens up many more career paths for an individual.  This particularly rings true for those with software development skills, [according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics] (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6).  
From a more philosophical standpoint, I believe that STEM is continuously misrepresented as a cohesive front.  At a fundamental level, I believe scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians approach problems in different ways.  This often leads to divides in multidisciplinary teams, in both knowledge and culture.  However, I believe there are thousands upon thousands of hidden or yet-to-be-seen connections between the 4 domains that could bridge them together. I pursued an education in two fields in order to begin my search for some of them - in the hopes that a more holistic understanding of STEM (and maybe one day STEAM) will prove my search to be fruitful.
