### Profile
My full name is Ezra Ablaza, and I currently attend Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. My email is <ezrabl42@gmail.com>.
### Education
My educational background is in Materials Science and Engineering, with a double major in Computer Science.  I'm expected to graduate in January 2019 with 173 degree credits (but for the most part that number does not matter).  For interested parties, I can forward an unofficial transcript, and Rutgers students may also [contact me](https://trestres.github.io/links) for course and textbook recommendations.  During the school semester, I operate as a shift tutor at the [Collaborative Academic Versatile Environment (CAVE)](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/resources/cave) located in Hill 252.  My hours will be posted as soon as they are confirmed.
### Experience
I have research experience in a variety of topics, including Visual Molecular Dynamics, Single Crystal Growth, and Compiler Analysis.  In the summer of 2017, I served an engineering internship at [Sterlite Technologies Ltd.](https://www.sterlitetech.com/), based in Aurangbad, Maharashtra, India.  While there, I worked in the R&D department on methods of predicting glass preform quality.  As of currently, I research with the Rutgers Laboratory of Computer Science Research (LCSR) under Georgiana Haldeman.  In addition, I also work as the front-end Project Lead for [HackRU](https://github.com/HackRU).
