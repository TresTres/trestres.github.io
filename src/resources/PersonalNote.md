At the most superficial level, [research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics] (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6) shows that the demand for software development skills is expected to increase at a "much faster" rate than the average across all occupations.  The same Bureau also reports a much slower growth rate than average for materials engineering jobs.  However, [a study conducted by Swerea](https://www.swerea.se/sites/default/files/the_future_of_materials_swerea.pdf) shows that materials development has an "endless demand" due to product requirements that continue to grow more stringent.   Pages 52-53 of the linked study show a possible roadmap for materials development in Sweden. If we picture a world of "choose one or the other", having the knowledge base of multiple disciplines can make a person competitive as a hire choice, or even integral for a multidiscipinary engineering team.

But this is a poor answer because it extracts a need from economic data, without a
